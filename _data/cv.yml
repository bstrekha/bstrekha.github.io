      institution: Quantum Transistors, Inc.
      year: Oct 2024 - Now
      description:
        - Designed new photonic devices and systems on chip operating at the quantum level (used Ansys FDTD, EME, FDE, MODE, HFSS, and Flexcompute Tidy3D).
        - Maintained an active library of components and internally developed photonic process design kits aimed at a photonic foundry (used GDSFactory, KLayout).
        - Developed and ran automated data collection routines for large-scale wafer-level testing of photonic devices.
        - Performed statistical analysis on collected data and built confidence models of measured physical parameters of optoelectronic devices.
