I currently live in New York City and work as a Photonics Design Engineer at Quantum Transistors. My interests lie in physics, math, electrical engineering, and computational science. I most enjoy topics which mix these fields, in accordance to the Goldilocks principle.

I spent the majority of my time growing up in Philadelphia, PA. I went to elementary, middle, and high school in Philadelphia, PA. I got my BA in physics in Philadelphia, PA from the University of Pennsylvania. I got my MS in physics in Philadel-- uh, I mean in Urbana-Champaign, IL from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Lastly, I studied in the electrical and computer engineering department at Princeton University (which happens to be pretty close to Philadelphia, PA) where I received a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. under the supervision of Alejandro W. Rodriguez. My dissertation, [Fundamental Bounds on Electromagnetic Phenomena](https://www.proquest.com/openview/84d069e58bbfe71e8df648f9bf60c7e2), focused on deriving expressions for torque due to fluctuating electric currents and on performance limits of optical devices.
