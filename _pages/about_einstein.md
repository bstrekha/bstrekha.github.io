I spent the majority of my time growing up in Philadelphia, PA. I went to elementary, middle, and high school in Philadelphia, PA. I got my BA in physics in Philadelphia, PA from the University of Pennsylvania. I got my MS in physics in Philadel-- uh, I mean in Urbana-Champaign, IL from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Lastly, I studied in the electrical and computer engineering PhD program at Princeton University (which happens to be pretty close to Philadelphia, PA).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
