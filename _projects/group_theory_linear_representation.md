I started writing notes on group theory. One big complaint I had when I was studying physics was that a lot of the math was often swept under the rug. The physics books were too light on the proofs, and just taught you how to do calculations. The math books were too abstract and tailored to budding mathematicians. So my idea was to write a textbook that proves as much of the math but then goes to examples and applications that theory inclined physics students would enjoy. A lot of the math theory is typed up, but I will need to focus on collecting all the physics examples and problems and typing that up. Maybe I'll find the time to do so eventually.
